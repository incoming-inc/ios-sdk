We provide a template application to make the SDK integration easy in a new project.

### Clone the Template Application ###

```git clone https://github.com/incoming-inc/ios-template-app```

### Import the iOS SDK zip ###

The PVN SDK distribution zip can be downloaded from your project in the Incoming control panel
(contact your Incoming media representative for access).

The distribution zip file contains a directory named incoming-ios-sdk, which itself contains:

* the Incoming SDK Framework
* the Incoming SDK Resource Bundle
* a sample configuration file sample-incoming-ios-sdk.plist
* README and CHANGELOG

Drag and drop the incoming-ios-sdk onto your XCode project. Tick "Copy items if needed".
