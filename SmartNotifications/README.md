Sourse Smart Notifications SDK template for iOS
===============================================

Simple template application that demonstrates how to integrate Sourse Smart Notifications in an iOS application, including A/B testing using firebase. 

This project requires
- the configuration file and SDK supplied by Sourse
- a Firebase project configured for Firebase cloud messaging


## Sourse SDK dependency

The sourse SDK version 2.6.1 or later is required

```

pod 'IncomingSDK/IncomingPVN', '~> 2.6.1'

```

## Sending smart notifications

Sourse's smart notifications are essentially silent notifications, sent using your existing push notification 
platform. C.f. the server folder for an example showing how to send such notifications using Firebase 
cloud messaging.

## Receiving smart notifications

The sourse SDK contain a method to detect wether a push notification is a sourse smart notification
or not. C.f. the client folder for the implementation details. 


## Smart notification payload specification

Note: all keys must be strings as per Firebase cloud messaging requirements. 

```
{
    // must be present in the payload
    'handler': 'com.sourse.notification',

    // the notification title text, visible to the end user
    'title':  'some title',
