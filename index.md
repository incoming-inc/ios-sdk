# Integrate the Push Video SDK #

The Incoming Push Video SDK can be used in a [new project](./new-project.html) by cloning the 
simple template application (swift or Objective-C), or integrated in an [existing project](./existing-project.html),
by dropping the SDK distribution folder into your project, and adding a small amount of code.
